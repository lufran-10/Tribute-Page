      <h2>A timeline of her life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1867</span> - Maria Salomea Skłodowska was born in Warsaw,

        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1890</span> - While she continued her studies at the Flying
          University, a clandestine Polish patriotic institution of higher
          learning that admitted women students, she began her practical
          scientific training in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of
          Industry and Agriculture, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was
          run by her cousin, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to
          the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Through all her studies she
          continued working as a governess.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1891</span> - She followed her elder sister to study in Paris
          at the Sorbonne, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted
          her subsequent scientific work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1895</span> - Marie married the French physicist Pierre Curie.
        </li>
        <li><span>1902</span> - She discovered pure radium.</li>
        <li>
          <span>1903</span> - Marie shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with her
          husband and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering
          work developing the theory of "radioactivity" — a term she coined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1904</span> - She was promoted to chief assistant to her
          husband in his laboratory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1906</span> - Pierre Curie died in Paris on a street accident.
          She took his place teaching at the Sorbonne and became the first
          woman professor there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1911</span> - She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her
          discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she
          invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1914</span> - During WWI, Marie used her radioactive research
          materials to do "x-rays". The x-rays were used to found bullets and
          other shrapnel in wounded soldiers.
        </li>
        <li><span>1920</span> - She founded the Curie Institute in Paris.</li>
        <li>
          <span>1922</span> - Marie became a member of the French Academy of
          Medicine. She devoted herself to using her knowledge to help people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1932</span> - Marie and her sister started a research facility
          to help fight cancer. It is still open today and it's called the
          Marie Sklodowska Curie Oncology Center.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>1934</span> - She died at the age of 66 in France, of aplastic
          anemia from exposure to radiation during her scientific research and
          in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during
          World War I.
